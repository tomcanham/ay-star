Graphical Demo of A* Pathfinding Algorithm

This is a React web app running against a Node.js API. It is a demonstration of the famous A* pathfinding algorithm. For details on A*, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm.

It's interesting to note that although perhaps the most famous use of A* is for pathfinding through virtual (computer game) or physical (robotics) spaces, the general case of pathfinding algorithms has applications far beyond simple navigation; any operation that can be represented as a sequence of decisions ('locations') with a cost between decision points ('distance') can be improved with pathfinding algorithms.
